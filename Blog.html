            <h2>The Great Escape: How Music Clears My Mind</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-29">Posted on September 29, 2025</time>
            <p>
                There's nothing quite like dropping a pair of headphones on and letting the world melt away. 
                For me, the intense, pulsating energy of **EDM Music**—the <mark>Dubstep, DNB, and RAVE</mark>
                —is more than just noise; it's a therapy for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment the heavy bass and intricate rhythms hit, I feel like my problems just *go away*. 
                The intensity of the music demands your full attention, drowning out mental clutter and stress, offering a momentary, powerful escape. 
                It allows me to reset, recalibrate, and come back to reality with a clearer mind.

            <p>
                Whether I'm coding or chilling, these tracks are my mental refresh button. Here are three go-to genres for instant headspace:
                <ol>
                    <li><abbr title="Electronic Dance Music">EDM</abbr> (for high energy, especially DNB)</li>
                    <li>HIPHOP (for pure rhythmic groove and thought-flow)</li>
                    <li>SAD Music (for a balanced, calming groove when the intensity is too much)</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>The Worlds Within: Why I Read Manga and Manhwa</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-25">Posted on September 25, 2025</time>
            <p>
                For pure escapism and storytelling, nothing beats **reading manga or manhwa**. It's an incredible hobby that lets me dive into rich, fantastical worlds, far removed from the constraints of web development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it's the beautiful *line work* of a classic shonen manga or the vibrant, full-color panels of a Korean manhwa, the artistry is truly inspiring. It reminds me that even in technical fields, creativity is key.

            <p>
                I am currently hooked on a fantasy manhwa that features incredible world-building. The dedication authors put into their craft is amazing, just like how we strive for <mark>perfectly structured HTML</mark>. Some genres I highly recommend are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Isekai</li>
                    <li>Action/Comedy</li>
                    <li>Fanstasy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
